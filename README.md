# minecraft-honeypot

Proxies all incoming connections to a minecraft server of your choosing, while also logging all ping and login requests to a json file and discord webhook. Originally built for the liveoverflow server, but do with it whatever you want (provided u follow the license).

im too lazy to make a readme.

# run

```bash
cargo run -- <config file>

# or download binary and run:

./proxypot <config file>

```

HUGE thanks to mat (mat#1592), who wrote [this](https://github.com/mat-1/azalea) whole library and listened to my nonsense the entire time I was building this. Super cool dude, you should give him your entire life savings.
